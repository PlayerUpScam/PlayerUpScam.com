        <p>
	Recently, I sold a digital item. When searching where to sell this item, many online posts recommended using <a href="https://playerup.com" target=_blank>PlayerUp.com</a> to sell the item, and given the number of recommendations, I throught that it was safe to give it a shot.
        </p>
        <p>
	The site even offered protection through an escrow service, called Middleman, which promised to safeguard the buyer and seller during the transaction. Little did I know that Middleman would fail to pay out $1,000 before PlayerUp ghosted me and began to remove public posts calling it out.
        </p>
        <p>
	This website is meant to bring awareness to anyone considering doing business on PlayerUp.com
        </p>
        <h2>False Sense of Security</h2>
        <p>
            Enter Middleman: PlayerUp's escrow service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Middleman promises to hold funds until a product has been delivered. The buyer pays Middleman, Middleman takes their cut, and both parties receive protection. Except, that's not how it works at all. In my experience, Middleman facilitated the sale but never paid out. Support ignored my requests through any official channels.
        </p>
        <p>
Plus, why would a scam site operate on the clear web when the site itself was the one doing the scamming and not the users on it?
        </p>
        <h2>Support Kept Me Hanging On for Hope</h2>
        <p>
            Occasionally, support would respond with vague promises or questions that seem like they're doing something. Except they would only ghost me after I answered. This gave me false hope that someone was working on my case, but ultimately, nothing was done.
        </p>
        <h2>Keeping The Site Clean</h2>
        <p>
            Middleman gave that false sense of security on PlayerUp.com. Its dispute forum is filled with problems from off-site transactions, but none with using Middleman. I found out why weeks after expecting my payment: the moderators remove negative feedback about Middleman from its Help and Dispute forums.
        </p>
        <p>
            When issues arose with my transaction, PlayerUp's moderators removed my public threads seeking help. This behavior prevents potential buyers from understanding the risks and creates a facade of a well-functioning marketplace.
        </p>
        <p>
	It's not just the forum where reviews are silenced. Posts online indicate that PlayerUp has threatened to withold pending cashouts until negative reviews are removed completely.
        </p>
        <h2>My Timeline</h2>
		<p>
		I gave PlayerUp a month to make this right before putting up this site, and now I come with receipts. Here is the timeline of what transpired:
		</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>11/07</strong> - Buyer purchased an item from me on PlayerUp</li>

        <h2>Ultimatum</h2>
        <p>
            I have reclaimed the item I sold until PlayerUp releases my funds. This website will remain up until my funds are released. PlayerUp has a history of bullying sellers into removing negative reviews, as shown in these <a href="https://www.epicnpc.com/threads/player-up-is-a-scam-you-will-be-100-scammed-as-a-buyer.1541937/post-7915452" target="_blank">examples</a>.
